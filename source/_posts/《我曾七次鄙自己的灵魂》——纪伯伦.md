The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.

第一次，当我本可进取时，却故作谦卑；

The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.

第二次，是当我看到自己在瘸子面前跛行而过时；

The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.​

第三次，当我在难易之间抉择时，我习惯性选择容易的；

The forth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.

第四次，是当我犯了错，却借由别人也会犯错来宽慰自己时；

The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.

第五次，当我的因为软弱一味忍让时，却把忍让说成了坚韧；

The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.

第六次，是当我鄙夷一张丑恶的嘴脸，却不知那正是自己面具中的一副时；

The seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.

第七次，是当我吟唱圣歌，却自诩为一种美德时。
